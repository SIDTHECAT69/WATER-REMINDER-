Welcome to **Hydration Nation** – the web app that gently (or not-so-gently) reminds you to **drink water before you turn into a raisin**. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this little project is here to save your life. Or at least your kidneys. 💀💦

## 🧠 What's This About?

Have you ever realized it's 8 PM and the only liquid you've consumed is iced coffee and regret? Yeah… same.

This project helps users:
- Track their daily water intake 💦
- Get fun and slightly passive-aggressive reminders 😅
- Stay cool and hydrated like a cucumber in a snowstorm 🥒❄️

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Open the web page.
2. Enter your daily water goal.
3. Log each cup/glass/bottle/chalice of water you drink.
4. Watch your hydration meter rise like a hero ascending to greatness.

All thanks to:
- **HTML** for the structure,
- **CSS** for those sweet hydrating vibes 💙,
- **JavaScript** for the brain juice 🧠.
